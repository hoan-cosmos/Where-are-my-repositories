Why I set all my repositories to private state?
----------
 - I recently sent my CV to FPT Software to apply for 3 months internship + on-site training at Automative R&D Lab, University of Information Technology, Vietnam National University Ho Chi Minh City.
 - That is the reason why I've set some of my repos to public state for them to review and know about my coding works.
 - Now I've been approved to be a part of this R&D Lab, so this is the time to set all my repos to private state again.
 - Why I want to set them private? Well It's just my liking.
 - Among all repos there is one called "FlymTV". FlymTV is a fork of [Flym](https://github.com/FredJul/Flym) by [Frédéric Julian](https://github.com/FredJul). I maintain and support Android TV format for this app. I started this project mainly for educational purpose, and the UI still seems not good, bugs, etc. so I don't want to make it public at present. But surely in the future I will set it to public state.
